  <!-- Predicting games -->
  <h3>1. Predicting games</h3>
  <p>Simply tap on the team you think is going to win. To change your prediction, tap on the other team or the draw button. That's all there is to it.</p>

  <!-- How scores are calculated -->
  <h3>2. How scores are calculated</h3>
  <p>For each game, all predictions are put into 'the pot', which is then split amongst the winners.</p>
  <h5>Example 1</h5>
  <p class="italic">If 100 players make a game prediction, and 80 players get it right, they will each be rewarded 1.25 points (100 divided by 80).</p>
  <h5>Example 2</h5>
  <p class="italic">If 100 players make a game prediction, and only 20 players get it right, they will each be rewarded 5 points (100 divided by 20).</p>
  <p>This means that, in some cases, you will be better off placing your prediction on the 'underdog'. <b>Make sure you click 'View Prediction Stats' to take advantage of this.</b></p>
  <p>You do not lose any points for getting a prediction wrong, so it is recommended that you make a prediction on every game!</p>

  <!-- Choosing a hero -->
  <h3>3. Choosing a class</h3>
  <p>Each class applies different WIN / LOSS modifiers on your predictions. Picking the right class for each set of
    games is the best way to get ahead.</p>
  <p> You can pick between the three available classes once per game day.</p>
  <p> To change your class, tap on the class button at the top of the games screen.</p>
